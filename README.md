# LottieShow

## Future ideas

They are, in no particular order:
- Monitor removal/insertion of External storage (see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html#getExternalStorageDirectory())
- Online library
- Export as video
- Show Lottie library version
- Change background colour (with a colour picker or a simple RGB value)
- auto-sync with Google drive or Dropbox
- export from Bodymovin
- "open from" using the system file picker
- resizing (during replay) with a slider.
- play:
  - continuous
  - back and forth
- reverse slider
- show in context (put a screen grab in the background)
